I'm a Backend Developer and a 3rd-year Applied Computer Science student at Lodz University of Technology, passionate about building secure, scalable, and well-tested applications. My main focus is on the **Java & Spring ecosystem**.

My team's project, **Harvestly**, recently won **2nd place in the Deloitte Digital Coding Challenge 2025**! 🏆

### 🚀 Featured Project: [Harvestly - Online Marketplace](https://github.com/j-lasota/harvestly)

Harvestly is a full-stack platform connecting local food vendors with customers. As a key backend developer on the team, I was responsible for a wide range of tasks, from core architecture to feature implementation and testing.

- 🏛️ **Architecture & Data Model:** Contributed to the design of the PostgreSQL database schema and implemented the core domain models using **Spring Data JPA / Hibernate**.

- 🛡️ **API Security:** Designed and implemented the entire API security layer using **Spring Security**. My work included securing a REST/GraphQL API with **JWT-based authentication** and a flexible **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system to distinguish between standard users and administrators.

- 🔄 **User & Data Synchronization:** Developed a robust user synchronization module to maintain data consistency between our local database and **Auth0**. This involved implementing both event-driven **webhooks** for real-time updates and **scheduled tasks** for periodic data validation and cleanup.

- 🔑 **External API Integration:** Built secure features requiring server-to-server communication, such as user-initiated password reset, by integrating with the **Auth0 Management API**.

- 🧪 **Testing & Reliability:** Authored a comprehensive suite of **integration tests** using **MockMvc** to validate all security rules, API endpoint behavior, and ensure thread-safe data handling, which was crucial for debugging complex race conditions.
